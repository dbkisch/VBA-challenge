# VBA-challenge
This README file has been updated to include more details about the Module 2 assignment, "VBA-challenge"

### Included in this submission:

- A VBA script that reads an Excel workbook containing daily stock data (ticker, date, opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, and volume) organized alphabetically by ticker into six separate tabs.
- Screen shots of the output

### Functionality:

The script loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information for each stock:
- The ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The total stock volume of the stock. 

The script also returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume" on each tab.
